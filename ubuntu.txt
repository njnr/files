修改ctrl CapsLock
omeone looks like

XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:nocaps"

mine looks like
XKBOPTIONS="lv3:ralt_alt,compose:menu,ctrl:nocaps"

sudo dpkg -reconfigure keyboard-configuration

The reason this way is better is that it will take effect on the virtual consoles (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+F1) as well as in the graphical desktop

重启网络管理 /etc/init.d/network-manager restart

ubuntu 下的vim是不支持系统剪贴板的，所以要安装vim-gnome
